    Understanding the Concept of Friend Function/Class and Operator Overloading
    2.  Write a class to store x, y, and z coordinates of a point in three-dimensional space.
        Overload addition and subtraction operators for addition and subtraction of two coordinate objects.
        Implement the operator functions as non-member functions (friend operator functions).
