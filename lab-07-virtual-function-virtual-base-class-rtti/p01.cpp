/*
    Lab 7
    Understanding the Concept of Virtual Function, Virtual Base Class, and RTTI
    1.  Write a program to create a class shape with functions to find the area of the
        shapes and display the names of the shapes and other essential components of the class.
        Create derived classes circle, rectangle, and trapezoid each having overriding functions
        area() and display(). Write a suitable program to illustrate virtual functions and virtual
        destructors.
